This project is a SASS (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) http://sass-lang.com/ implementation of the Baseline CSS grid: http://baselinecss.com/

Baseline's standard grid is 8 columns. This SASS implementation allows you to specify the number of columns, and the gutter through variables to produce nearly any grid implementation and be able to leverage the rest of the goodness in Baseline such
as its typography, forms, etc.

I removed the concept of "widths" from Baseline and just went with straight "unitx[column]" definitions for simplicity.

Requirements:
---------------
Ruby 1.9.x
RubyGems
Sass
The rest of Baseline, minus the grid.

To compile the SASS .scss files into .css, I recommend using the 'compass' Ruby gem, which can be used independently of any operating system,
web framework or programming language.

Enjoy!
